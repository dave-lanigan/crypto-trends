### INTRO
This purpose of this project is to download, consolidate, transform and prepare cryptocurrency price, volume and google trend data for analysis and exploration.
<br />
To accomplish this a list data was acquired from (3) different sources. The first was coingecko API where a list of viable coin candidate were pulled along with information about each coin. hose coins ranked in the top ~50 by market cap that were supported on Binance. Binance support was chosen for its ubiquity as a cryptocurrency exchange, strong API and fairly low trading fees.
